    return df
```

### 2. Feature Engineering
```python
def engineer_features(df):
    # Age calculation
    df['vehicle_age'] = current_year - df['year']
    
    # Depreciation rate
    df['depreciation_rate'] = calculate_depreciation(df)
    
    # Market segment classification
    df['market_segment'] = classify_segment(df)
    
    return df
```

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation

## üöó Usage Examples

### Basic Price Prediction
```python
from vehicle_price_predictor import VehiclePricePredictor

# Initialize the predictor
predictor = VehiclePricePredictor()

# Define vehicle specifications
vehicle_specs = {
    'make': 'Toyota',
    'model': 'Camry',
    'year': 2019,
    'mileage': 45000,
    'fuel_type': 'Gasoline',
    'transmission': 'Automatic',
    'condition': 'Good',
    'location': 'California'
}

# Get price prediction
estimated_price = predictor.predict(vehicle_specs)
print(f"Estimated Price: ${estimated_price:,.2f}")
```

### Market Analysis
```python
# Analyze market trends for specific models
market_analysis = predictor.analyze_market_trends(
    make='Honda',

```

### Comparative Market Analysis
```python
# Compare similar vehicles in the market
